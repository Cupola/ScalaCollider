h3. requirements / installation

ScalaOSC currently compiles against Scala 2.8.0.RC1. It requires Java 1.6 and SuperCollider 3.3.1+. It depends on ScalaOSC ( "github.com/Sciss/ScalaOSC":http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaOSC ).

The repository contains a project file for Intellij IDEA 9 CE, and project files for sbt. Targets for sbt:

* @clean@
* @compile@
* @doc@
* @package@
* @demo@

The easiest way to install ScalaOSC is to go into your clone of the ScalaOSC git repository, and then execute

@$ sbt publish-local@

After wards, go back into the clone of the ScalaCollider git repository, and simply run

@$ sbt update@

which should find ScalaOSC in your local Ivy repository.

h3. running the demo

The demo target starts a REPL and executes the file @console-startup.txt@ which by default imports the necessary packages and creates a default server. make sure that @s.options.programPath.value@ is set correctly. ScalaCollider will by default read the environment variable @SC_HOME@. Environment variables are stored depending on your operating system. On OS X, if you use the app-bundle of ScalaCollider-Swing, you can access them from the terminal:

pre. $ touch ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist
$ open ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist

On the other hand, if you run ScalaCollider from a Bash terminal, you instead edit @~/.bash_profile@. The entry is something like @export SC_HOME=/path/to/folder-of-scsynth@. On linux, the environment variables probably go in @~/.profile@.

Finally, to boot the server:

@scala> s.boot@

Please refer to @ExampleCmd.txt@ for some example code. There is also an introductory video for the "Swing frontend":http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaColliderSwing at "www.screencast.com/t/YjUwNDZjMT":http://www.screencast.com/t/YjUwNDZjMT
